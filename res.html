    <h1>Colors</h1>
    <p>
        <h2>What is Your Favorite Color?</h2>
     My favorite color is pink. There are a lot of special colors, but the color pink is the color for my personality. The first uniform I got was pink. Before they used to be only white. White is beautiful and clean, but I think pink better expresses the peace and contentment of me. In conclusion, people who wear pink are supposed to be warm and understanding. The message that you would like to share is your peace and happiness with others. That’s why pink is my color.

        <h2>Makes Me Happy</h2> 
        I like green a lot. We can see trees grass and plants all around us. These are in green. I think green is a part of our world. We cannot live without the greenery around us. Do you prefer to walk in a dry desert or in the rich forest? Forests makes me feel fresher and relaxed as well. I think climbing mountains is the happiest way to spend my vacation. There are millions of plans around me. It makes me feel fresh and healthy. Colorgenics think that people who wear green often like the outdoors.  I think going outdoors makes people happy. So I’m the girl for the color green.
